# Sum of All Integers

## Intro Information

* Whiteboarding problems
    * Still a leading favorite tool for employers to test interviewees, whiteboarding problems are asked by having the interviewee answer a coding problem without a computer usually with a marker at a whiteboard.
    * Most whiteboarding problems involve writing a function with no global variables, only input and output.
    * For these morning problems if you want to work with a partner at the whiteboard, this would be a very good practice.
        * It reinforces syntax practicing without the help of something like visual studio code.
        * It helps with confidence when you are at the real whiteboard.
        * Practicing code spacing so you aren't erasing as much and are leaving room for extra code when you write is really helpful, and something not often thought about when coding from the computer.
    * Begin by pseudo-coding. 
        * Many companies are judging more on problem solving skills than coding chops, so having strong pseudo-coding skills to fall back on may help with the interview process. 

## Instructions

* Write a function that takes in an integer and outputs the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that integer.
    * Examples:
        ```
        Input: 2
        Output: 3 (because 1 + 2 = 3)
        ```
        ```
        Input: 4
        Output: 10  (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)
        ```
        ```
        Input: 10
        Output: 55
        ```
