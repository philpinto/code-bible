### Pre-Class Drill

* Extra info:

  * There are a few different types of interview problems that you'll see as developers.

  * Some focus on logic, like the ones we've seen so far, and some focus on measuring understanding of the language.

  * JavaScript has a lot of quirks that make it unique from other languages. Understanding those quirks will make you stronger JavaScript developers.

* Instructions: Run the following code and explain the output:

```js
var sample = function(){
  var a = b = 3;
}
sample();
console.log("Is a defined?", typeof a !== "undefined");
console.log("Is b defined?", typeof b !== "undefined");

```
