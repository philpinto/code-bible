# ANSWERS:

* `var a = b = 3` is equivalent to writing:

```js
b = 3;
var a = b;
```

* This means that `b` is created globally (unless you use strict mode) because there is no `var` keyword in the variable definition.

* After `b` is created globally, `b` is assigned the value 3. Then `a` is created locally inside the function and assigned the value of `b`, which is 3.

* Because `a` is created locally, it doesnâ€™t exist outside the function.
