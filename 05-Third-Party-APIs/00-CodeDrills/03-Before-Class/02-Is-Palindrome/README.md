# Is Palindrome

## Intro Information

* It's okay if you aren't able to complete these problems in 15 minutes. In interviews, you will often be confronted with problems that you won't know how to solve.

* The important thing is that you are trying to think through the problems and are actively working to find a solution for the full 15 minutes. Start with what you know and don't give up!

* Also remember there are infinite solutions to problems, just because yours is different, doesn't mean it won't also work!

* Whiteboarding problems
    * Still a leading favorite tool for employers to test interviewees, whiteboarding problems are asked by having the interviewee answer a coding problem without a computer usually with a marker at a whiteboard.
    * Most whiteboarding problems involve writing a function with no global variables, only input and output.
    * For these morning problems if you want to work with a partner at the whiteboard, this would be a very good practice.
        * It reinforces syntax practicing without the help of something like visual studio code.
        * It helps with confidence when you are at the real whiteboard.
        * Practicing code spacing so you aren't erasing as much and are leaving room for extra code when you write is really helpful, and something not often thought about when coding from the computer.
    * Begin by pseudo-coding. 
        * Many companies are judging more on problem solving skills than coding chops, so having strong pseudo-coding skills to fall back on may help with the interview process. 

## Instructions

* Write a function that takes in a single word as a string and returns true if itâ€™s a palindrome and false otherwise (a palindrome is spelled the same way forwards and backwards).
    * Examples:
    ```
    Input: "noon"
    Output: true
    ```
    ```
    Input: "horse"
    Output: false
    ```
    ```
    Input: "racecar"
    Output: true
    ```
