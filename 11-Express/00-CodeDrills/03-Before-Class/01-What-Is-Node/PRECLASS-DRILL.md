# Pre-class Drill

## Information:

* Interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and you need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make you great developers, and these pre-class questions are designed to make you awesome interviewers.

## Problem:

* There are multiple kinds of interview questions. We've largely practiced coding problems, but you should expect to encounter discussion problems as well.

* Try not to Google. You should write your own definition of Node.
