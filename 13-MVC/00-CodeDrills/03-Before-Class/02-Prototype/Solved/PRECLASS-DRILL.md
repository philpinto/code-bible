# Pre-class Drill

## Solution:

  * Prototypes hold properties and methods that _all_ objects of that type can access.

  * For example, the Array prototype has the `push`, `map`, `any`,  `filter`, and `includes` methods. That's why every array can use those methods.

  * The prototype can be thought of as a centralized storage place for functionality that all objects of a type share access to.
