### Pre-class Drill

## What are pre-class drills?

* It's time for the pre-class drill of the day! Interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and you need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make you great developers, and these pre-class questions are designed to make you awesome interviewers.

* With each pre-class drill you should begin by pseudo-coding. Many companies are judging more on problem solving skills than coding chops, so having strong pseudo-coding skills to fall back on is a huge positive. When the problem allows, you should practice on the white board.  It's beneficial for you to do it in the classroom rather than wait for your first time to be during interviews, it helps with stress, memorization, and text spacing/cleanliness.

## Instructions:

* Find a partner and answer the following together:

```
 What is a self-closing tag? Provide 3 examples. Why are these tags self-closing? What differentiates these elements from others? 
```
 
* Tip: practice your critical thinking rather than your Googling skills here.
