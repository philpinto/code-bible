# Other Third Party APIs

* Description:

    * There are more third party code APIs out there than just jQuery, we can also include other libraries to make our lives easier with different aspects of javascript.

    * In programming one of the most confusing things to program can be dates and time.  moment.js is a library of code that lets us have an easier time manipulating dates.

* Getting started with moment.js

    * just like with jQuery we can add a link to a script tag pointed to a [moment cdn](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/moment.js/) above our own javascript like so:
    ```html
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.24.0/moment.min.js"></script>
        <script src="index.js"></script>
    ```

    * Also spend a moment perusing [moment's documentation](https://momentjs.com/)

        * Focus on: 

            * How can you get the current time?
            
            * How can you format a date?

            * How can you find the difference between two dates?

* Instructions:

    * Follow the comments in the script.js file to answer the questions.

    * Use both jQuery and moment to accomplish what is asked in the code.
