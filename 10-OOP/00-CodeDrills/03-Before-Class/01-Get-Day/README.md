# Pre-class Drill

* It's time for the preclass drill of the day. Interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and you will need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make you great developers, and these pre-class questions are designed to make you awesome interviewers.

* You should begin by pseudo-coding. Many companies are judging more on problem solving skills than coding chops, so having strong pseudo-coding skills to fall back on is important. It is highly recommended to do this activity at the actual whiteboard. Practicing there gives you a sense of how it will feel in the actual interview, so it is a good practice to simulate that.
