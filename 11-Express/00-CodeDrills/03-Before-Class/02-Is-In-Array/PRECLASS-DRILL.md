# Pre-class Drill

## Information:

* Interviewing is a skill that is in some ways separate from practical coding, and you need to work hard to hone this skillset during this course. The class is designed to make you great developers, and these pre-class questions are designed to make you awesome interviewers.

* Begin by pseudo-coding. Many companies are judging more on problem solving skills than coding chops, so having strong pseudo-coding skills to fall back on is very important. You should practice white boarding in the classroom rather than wait for your first time to be during interviews. 

## Problem:

```js
Write a function that takes 2 parameters - the first is an array, the second is an element that may or may not be in the array. 
Without using any built in array methods, return true if the element is in the array or false otherwise. 
. 

Ex:
Input: [1,2,3]  1
Output: true

Input: [1,2,3]  4
Output: false

Input: ['code', 'dev', 'nerd']  'nerd'
Output: false

Input: ['code', 'dev', 'nerd']  'genius'
Output: false
 ```
